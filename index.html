        <p>
          This website serves as a guide for me and for other people learning
          web development. This also serve as my practice as I learn concepts in
          web development. So if you think this website is trash, it means I still
          have a lot of things to learn. And I will take it personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason I made this website is because everytime I came accross a helpful website
          or youtube videos, I immediately put it inside my bookmark folders. And right now,
          my bookmark bar is full it looks crowded, so I decided to make this. In this way,
          I can manage all the links as I see fit and I get to practice my skill in web programming.
          It's like hitting two birds in one stone.
